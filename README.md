# Haskell-Prolog exercises
Every week, The Sunday Times newspaper publishes a Teaser. 
First two questions were answered using Haskell and the other two using Prolog.
Check the answers by copying and pasting the code into online compilers:

## Question 1: Gill’s primes

Teaser 3154, Gill’s Primes, by Bill Kinally, of Sunday 5th March 2023, was as follows.
Jack told Gill “I have found three equally-spaced prime numbers, 29, 41, and 53.
The difference between the first and second is the same as the difference between the
second and third, and there are no repeated digits in the six digits of my primes.”
Gill told Jack she had also found three equally-spaced primes, each having three
digits with no repeated digits in the nine digits of her primes. She said, “If I told
you that the three-digit sum of each of my primes is an odd number then you should
be able to find them.”
In ascending order, what are Gill’s three primes?
- The answer given by the newspaper was 157, 283, 409.

## Question 2: Common names

Teaser 3137, Common Names, by Victor Bryant, of Sunday 6th November 2022, was as
follows.
Eight friends met at a party; their ages in whole numbers of years were all different.
They were Alan, Cary, James, Lucy, Nick, Ricky, Steve and Victor, with Lucy being
the youngest. For each of them, the square of their age was a three-figure number
consisting of three different digits. Furthermore, for any two of them, the squares
of their ages had at least one digit in common precisely when their names had a
least one letter in common.
In alphabetical order of their names, what are the eight ages?
- The answer given by the newspaper was 19, 31, 29, 16, 25, 23, 28 and 27. Note,
however, that to obtain this answer, one has to assume that names are not case-sensitive:
“alan” not “Alan”, “cary”, not “Cary”, “james” not “James” and so on

## Question 3: Bilateral symmetry
Teaser 3132, of Sunday 1st October 2022, Bilateral Symmetry, by Susan Bricket, was as
follows.
My son, at a loose end after A-levels, asked me for a mental challenge, As we’d been
discussing palindromes, I suggested he try to find an arrangement of the digits 1 to
9 with the multiplication symbol “x” to give a palindrome as the answer, and he
came up with 29678x1453 = 43122134. I said “Now try to find the smallest such
palindromic product starting in 4, where the last digit of the smallest number is still
3”. He found that smallest product, and, interestingly, if he added the two smaller
numbers instead of multiplying them, then added 100, he also go a palindrome.
What was the smallest product?
- The answer given by the newspaper was 40699604.

## Question 4: In his prime
Teaser 3231, of Sunday 25th August 2024, In His Prime, by Victor Bryant, was as follows.
Once, on my grandson’s birthday, I asked him the following five questions:
How many days are there in this month?
How many Mondays are there in this month?
How many “prime” days (ie, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, . . . ) are there in this month?
How many of those prime days are Saturdays?
How many letters are there when you spell the month?
The total of the five answers was a prime number.
Then I asked him the same questions the next day. No answer was the same as for
the day before, but again the total of the five answers was prime.
When I first asked the questions what was the month and day of the
week?
- The answer given by the newspaper was February, Monday or Friday (apologies for
the multiple answers).
